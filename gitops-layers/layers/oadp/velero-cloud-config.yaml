# Velero Cloud Configuration Secret
# 
# NOTE: This file is named velero-cloud-config.yaml to avoid gitignore
# patterns that block files with "secret" or "credentials" in the name.
# The Secret is still named "cloud-credentials" as expected by OADP.
#
# This secret tells Velero to use IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
# instead of static AWS credentials.
#
# The IAM role ARN is configured in the DataProtectionApplication CR.
# This minimal credentials file enables STS authentication.
